# Todo-List-App
This repository hosts the source code for a decentralized ToDoList app (dApp) built using Ethereum's blockchain technology. The dApp allows users to create, manage, and track their tasks in a secure and transparent manner. The backend of the application is implemented in Solidity, ensuring the integrity and immutability of task and user's data.
